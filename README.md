# BiFiX ðŸ‘¤ðŸ’¡

The Big Five Integration on WEXTOR is an open source &amp; open data project on personality data.ðŸŒŽ

In this repository, you will find the **open data files** under the `data` folder: 
- `BiFiX_data.csv` is the full data collected by the BiFiX tool running on the WEXTOR account of _TheTave_ and
- `BiFiX_DO.csv` is an edited version that already excludes "participants" that did not make it past the first page.

The latter dataset allows for meaningful dropout analysis, hence the abbreveation "DO". For this, I highly recommend our `dropR` tool, usable either as a package directly in R or as a Shiny Web App (read the [vignettes](https://iscience-kn.github.io/dropR/) to learn more about `dropR`)! ðŸ‘¾

The **tool itself** is contained in the `BiFiX.zip` folder. 
The experiment is based on HTML and JavaScript and is designed to be hosted on [WEXTOR](https://wextor.eu/) - an experimental design platform for creating and hosting psychological experiments.

We plan to present the BiFiX project at this year's SCiP conference ([Society for Computation in Psychology](https://computationinpsych.com/)).

The BiFiX is part of Anni Tave Overlander's Ph.D. project. Find me on GitHub @the-tave!ðŸ¤˜
